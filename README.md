## Clustering techniques
1. K means Clustering : K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a predetermined number of clusters. The goal is to group data points into clusters where each point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). 
3. Hierarchical Clustering : Hierarchical clustering is another popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points into clusters. Unlike k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance. Instead, it creates a hierarchy of clusters, also known as a dendrogram.
4. DBSCAN : DBSCAN is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups together closely packed points based on their density. Unlike k-means or hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand. Instead, it can find any number of clusters and is robust to outliers.

## Pre-Processing techniques
1. Normalization : Normalization is a technique used to scale numeric features in a dataset to a standard range. The purpose is to bring all features to the same scale, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This is important in machine learning algorithms, particularly those sensitive to feature scales, such as gradient descent-based algorithms.
2. PCA (Principle Component Analysis) : PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving most of the information. It does this by transforming the original features into a new set of orthogonal features called principal components.
3. Transform : Transformation involves modifying the distribution of data to make it more suitable for analysis or modeling. Common transformations include logarithmic, exponential, and power transformations.
4. Scale : Scaling is similar to normalization but may involve different scaling factors. It transforms features to have a specific range or distribution, often for better performance of machine learning algorithms.
